 * The Window class creates a new toplevel window.
 *
 * A window is similar to a frame except that it is created as a top-level 
 * widget. The primary purpose of a toplevel is to serve as a container for 
 * dialog boxes and other collections of widgets.
 *
 * Example:
 * ---
 * auto window = new Window("New window")
 * 	.setGeometry(640, 480, 10, 10)
 * 	.setDefaultIcon(new Png!("icon.png"))
 * 	.setMaxSize(1024, 768)
 * 	.setProtocolCommand(WindowProtocol.deleteWindow, delegate(CommandArgs args){ ... });
 * ---
 * Additional_Events:
 *     Additional events that can also be bound to using the $(LINK2 ../element/uielement.html#UiElement.bind, bind) method.
 *     $(P
 *         &lt;&lt;PrevWindow&gt;&gt;,
